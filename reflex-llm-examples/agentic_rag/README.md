# Agentic RAG with Gemini 2.0 Flash  

This is not just a simple "Chat with PDF" app. It's an **Agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** system powered by **Gemini 2.0 Flash**. The app first searches through the uploaded document for relevant information. If the required information is not found in the document, it seamlessly searches the web and returns a comprehensive response.

## Features  
- **Upload PDF Documents:** Easily upload any PDF document to start querying.  
- **Agentic RAG Workflow:** Combines document retrieval with web search for accurate and comprehensive answers.  
- **Interactive Q&A:** Ask questions about the content of the uploaded PDF or general queries.  
- **Powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash:** Utilizes Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model for fast and accurate responses.  
- **Web Search Integration:** If the document doesn't contain the required information, the app searches the web and provides relevant results.

## Getting Started  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex-llm-examples.git  
cd reflex-llm-examples/agentic_rag
```  

### 2. Install Dependencies  
Install the required dependencies:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### 3. Set Up Gemini API Key  
To use the Gemini 2.0 Flash model, you need a **Google API Key**. Follow these steps:  
Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), get your API Key an set the API key as an environment variable:  
   ```bash  
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"  
   ```  

### 4. Set Up PgVector  
The app uses **PgVector** for vector storage and retrieval. Follow these steps to set it up:  

1. **Install Docker Desktop:** Ensure Docker Desktop is installed on your machine.  
2. **Run the PgVector Docker Container:** Use the following command to start the PgVector container:  
   ```bash  
   docker run -d \
     -e POSTGRES_DB=ai \
     -e POSTGRES_USER=ai \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ai \
     -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
     -v pgvolume:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
     -p 5532:5432 \
     --name pgvector \
     agnohq/pgvector:16
   ```  

3. **Verify the Container is Running:**  
   Run the following command to confirm that the PgVector container is running:  
   ```bash  
   docker ps  
   ```  
   You should see an entry for `pgvector` with port `5532` listed.  

4. **Connect to the Database:**  
   Access the PostgreSQL shell inside the container with this command:  
   ```bash  
   docker exec -it pgvector psql -U ai -d ai  
   ```  

5. **Create a New Table with Vector(768):**  
   Setup up a new table with an embedding column of dimension 768, run the following SQL command:  
   ```sql  
   CREATE TABLE pdf_documents_v2 (
     id character varying PRIMARY KEY,
     name character varying,
     meta_data jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
     filters jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
     content text,
     embedding vector(768),  -- Embedding column with 768 dimensions
     usage jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
     content_hash VARCHAR
   );
   ```  

### 5. Run the Reflex App  
Start the application to begin interacting with your PDF:  
```bash  
reflex run  
```

## How It Works  
1. **Upload a PDF:** The app processes the document and creates a searchable knowledge base.  
2. **Ask Questions:** The app first searches the uploaded document for relevant information.  
3. **Web Search Fallback:** If the document doesn't contain the required information, the app searches the web using **DuckDuckGo** and returns the most relevant results.  
4. **Comprehensive Responses:** The app combines information from the document and the web to provide accurate and detailed answers.

## Why Agentic RAG?  
- **Document-Centric:** Focuses on extracting information from the uploaded PDF.  
- **Web-Augmented:** Ensures no query goes unanswered by leveraging web search when needed.  
- **Efficient and Accurate:** Combines the best of both worlds for a seamless experience.  

---

## Troubleshooting  
- **Gemini API Key Not Set:** Ensure the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly.  
- **PgVector Not Running:** Verify that the PgVector Docker container is running and accessible on port `5532`.
